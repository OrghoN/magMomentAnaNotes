# Training Transformer_ee for Nova 

This guide is for training transformer_ee with data from nova.
It assumes that you already have the `.xz` dataset that you want to train on. If you don't already have that, instructions on generating the dataset can be found on this [github page.](https://github.com/OrghoN/magMomentAnaNotes/blob/main/transformerDataExtractorInstructions.md)
The Example used in this guide will be for the near detector forward horn current dataset  and will assume that the locations of the files generated are in the locations mentioned on the [data extraction guide.](https://github.com/OrghoN/magMomentAnaNotes/blob/main/transformerDataExtractorInstructions.md)
